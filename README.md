# 🚂 Desktop Train Perimeter Sim

An aesthetic, high-performance desktop overlay that brings a miniature, top-down railway to life along the extreme edges of your monitor. Optimized for a compact "lo-fi" workspace atmosphere.

## 📖 How to Play

Your train travels along the perimeter of your desktop. Your goal is to build a thriving transportation and recycling network while managing hardware stress and energy levels.

### 1. The Transit Cycle (Active Income)
The world contains two main **Terminals** (Alpha & Omega) where citizens wait for transport.
- **Stop Logic**: To pick up passengers, your train **MUST have at least one Habitat Wagon** (Residential). Without it, you are considered "Express Cargo" and will skip all stops.
- **Capacity**: Every **Passenger Coach** (Standard Wagon) increases your passenger capacity by **10 people**.
- **The Payoff**: When you reach a terminal, your current passengers disembark and pay a fare in **Scrap Metal**. Then, new passengers board until the train is full.

### 2. The Recycling Loop (Passive Income)
- **Habitats**: These units produce a small, steady stream of Scrap Metal while moving.
- **Sorting Wagons**: These industrial units provide a **+50% multiplier** to all scrap gained from both Habitats and Terminal Fares.

### 3. Energy & Maintenance
- **Refueling**: If energy falls below 15%, an automated drone launches from the nearest **Energy Hub** to refuel you.
- **CPU Heat**: Long trains and high speeds increase boiler load. If heat stays in the red zone, the system will derail, requiring a manual reboot via drone.
- **Upgrades**: Invest in **Exhaust Vents** to handle higher speeds and **Efficiency Cores** to reduce fuel consumption.
