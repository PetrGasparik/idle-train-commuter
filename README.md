# 🚂 Desktop Train Perimeter Sim

An aesthetic, high-performance desktop overlay that brings a miniature, top-down railway to life along the extreme edges of your monitor. Optimized for a compact "lo-fi" workspace atmosphere.

## ✨ Core Features

- **Sector 01 - Draggable Command Post**:
  - The entire UI anchor is a physical "Station" structure on your desktop.
  - **Click-Through Optimized**: Clicks pass through to background apps unless hovering over UI.
  - **Draggable**: Grab the station to reposition your entire control hub. It remembers its position.

- **Idle Economy (V3)**:
  - **Passive Income**: Residential/Habitat wagons generate Scrap Metal while the train is in motion.
  - **Mining Multiplier**: Mining wagons boost the scrap yield of manual mouse clicks by 50%.
  - **Neural Fabricator**: Use Gemini 2.5 Flash to synthesize custom top-down skins for your locomotive.

- **The Overseer Drone**:
  - **Automated Life Support**: Intercepts the train when energy falls below 15% for rapid refueling.
  - **Direct Intercept**: Calculates shortest flight paths from Command Post to the train.

## 🎮 Mechanics & Resources

| Resource | Source | Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Energy** | Keyboard input / Manual Pulse / Drone | Movement speed and visual glow (Green/Amber/Red). |
| **Scrap** | Mouse clicks / Residential Wagons | Buy Wagons (10 SC), Mining (15 SC), Habitats (20 SC), or Efficiency. |
| **Overseer** | Command Post | Automated refueling drone. |

## 🛠 Stability Note
If the Command Post disappears, ensure you haven't changed monitor configurations. The system now includes an "Auto-Rescue" feature that resets the position if it's detected off-screen.
