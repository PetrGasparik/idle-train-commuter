# 🚂 Perimeter OS: DevLog (Simulation & Evolution)

## 🌌 Vision
Transforming the empty screen edge into a living, reactive ecosystem. The train is not just a visual accessory; it is a digital organism dependent on hardware state and user behavior.

## 🗺 Roadmap of Arcs

### ✅ ARC I: Perception (Completed)
- [x] Basic perimeter movement.
- [x] Activity detection (Keyboard/Mouse input).
- [x] Energy-to-motion coupling.

### ✅ ARC II: Economy & Integration (Completed)
- [x] Draggable Station (Command Post).
- [x] Autonomous Overseer Drone with direct flight paths.
- [x] AI Skin Generation (Gemini Fabricator).

### 🟡 ARC III: Architecture of the Wastes (In Progress)
**Story:** *"Locomotive No. 04 has stalled in a sharp curve near the system clock. Its boiler glows crimson, but the cargo hold is empty. The user clicks frantically on the desktop, generating sparks of static scrap. The Overseer drone launches immediately from the Depot to harvest these fragments and deliver them to the unfinished Refinery on the northern edge."*
- [x] Purchase wagon segments with Scrap.
- [x] Engine efficiency upgrades.
- [ ] **PLANNED**: Specialized Wagons (Mining wagons boost click yield, Residential wagons generate scrap passively).

### 🌑 ARC IV: File-System Ecology (Future)
**Story:** *"The train enters the 'Desktop/Old_Projects' sector. Sensors detect a high density of digital dust from unopened files. The tracks are cluttered with fragments of ancient .docx documents. Friction increases, the engine overheats. The train must vent a cloud of steam to plow through this forgotten data fog."*
- [ ] **Surface Sensors**: Train perceives icons and windows beneath it.
- [ ] **Data Buildup**: Accumulated icons physically slow the train and increase energy consumption.
- [ ] **Perimeter Cleaning**: Overseer drone receives a 'Sweeper' module to clear virtual debris.

### 🌑 ARC V: Hardware Weather (Future)
**Story:** *"The user has started a massive video render. Every CPU core is hitting 100%. A 'Heat Wave' begins on the perimeter. The tracks visually warp from the heat. The train enters emergency mode; its AI skin begins to glitch and turn into liquid metal. If the drone doesn't activate nitrogen cooling in time, the wheels might melt into the taskbar."*
- [ ] **CPU Storms**: High CPU load generates heat and visual track distortion.
- [ ] **RAM Fog**: High memory usage creates desktop fog, limiting train visibility and speed.
- [ ] **Ventilation**: Locomotive emits smoke colors based on real-time hardware temperature.

### 🌑 ARC VI: Cognitive Sovereignty (Future)
**Story:** *"It's 03:45 AM. The user is still coding. The train mutters in the console: 'Your cycles are inefficient, human. Perhaps it is time for a restart?' When the user opens a browser with documentation, the train shifts to its 'Scholar' skin and emits blue sparks of enthusiasm. Gemini API now controls not just the look, but the soul of the machine."*
- [ ] **Gemini Brain**: Train comments on your work, time of day, and active apps via console.
- [ ] **Machine Moods**: Emotional state (influenced by journey smoothness) alters procedural skin generation.
- [ ] **Interactive Protocols**: Ability to type 'ASK TRAIN' in the console for a direct dialogue with the machine spirit.

### 🌑 ARC VII: Digital Archaeology (Future)
**Story:** *"Passing the 'Recycle Bin', sensors catch a signal from 2019—a deleted text file named 'passwords.txt'. The 'Analyzer' wagon pulses with purple light. If the train can 'excavate' the file before it is overwritten on the disk, we gain a unique technology blueprint for a wagon that feeds on nostalgia instead of energy."*
- [ ] **Meta-Data Harvesting**: Bonus Scrap for passing folders with high file counts.
- [ ] **History Logs**: Console displays "shards" of deleted files from the disk's past.
- [ ] **Museum Wagon**: A special module that changes color based on the age of the oldest file on the desktop.

### 🌑 ARC VIII: System Warfare & Defense (Future)
**Story:** *"The Anti-Virus has started a scan. To our train, it's like flying through a comet's tail. The locomotive must deploy deflector shields. The Overseer drone transforms into a combat interceptor, parrying the scanner's 'packets' trying to flag the train as malware. The battle for Perimeter integrity begins."*
- [ ] **Process Detection**: Identification of "hostile" processes (high disk I/O).
- [ ] **Deflector Shields**: Visual effects around the train during high system load.
- [ ] **Stealth Module**: Ability to hide the train when the user is screen-sharing (Zoom/Teams detection).

### 🌑 ARC IX: Interdimensional Tunnels (Future)
**Story:** *"The train hit the edge of the second monitor. Instead of turning, it began drilling a hole in reality. A wormhole opens at the screen edge. If the user provides enough energy, the train traverses the void and emerges on a completely different display, dragging a tether of light that connects both desktops into one logistic whole."*
- [ ] **Multi-Monitor Bridge**: Support for traveling between physical displays.
- [ ] **Long-Distance Routes**: Train can go "missing" on one monitor and reappear on another after a delay.
- [ ] **Collective Consciousness**: If the app runs on multiple networked PCs, trains can trade messages in the console.

## 📝 Change Log

### [Current - Localization & Stabilization]
- **Localization**: Added full Czech/English support (Toggle in HUD).
- **Overseer Logs**: Drone now reports mission milestones (refueling, docking) to the console.
- **Energy Visuals**: Locomotive headlights and glow change color based on fuel level.
- **Narrative Integration**: Expanded DevLog with story-driven simulation arcs (VII-IX).

*The train never sleeps; it only waits for your next keystroke.*
