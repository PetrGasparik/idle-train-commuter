# 🚂 Perimeter OS: DevLog (Simulation & Evolution)

## 🌌 Vision
Transforming the empty screen edge into a living, reactive ecosystem. The train is a digital organism dependent on hardware state and user behavior.

## 🗺 Roadmap of Arcs

### ✅ ARC I: Perception (Completed)
- [x] Basic perimeter movement and collision-less corners.
- [x] Activity detection (Energy-to-motion coupling).

### ✅ ARC II: Economy & Integration (Completed)
- [x] Draggable Command Post (Station).
- [x] Autonomous Overseer Drone (Direct flight intercept).
- [x] Gemini Fabricator (AI Procedural Skins).

### ✅ ARC III: Architecture of the Wastes (Completed)
- [x] **Mining Wagons**: Active yield boost.
- [x] **Residential Wagons**: Passive scrap generation.
- [x] **Stability Patch**: Fixed "disappearing hub" and Electron click-through bugs.

### 🌑 ARC IV: Hardware Weather (Future)
- [ ] **CPU Storms**: High CPU load generates visual track distortion/heat.
- [ ] **RAM Fog**: High memory usage creates desktop fog, limiting speed.
- [ ] **Thermal Smoke**: Locomotive emits different smoke colors based on real-time CPU temp.

### 🌑 ARC V: Cognitive Sovereignty (Future)
- [ ] **Gemini Soul**: Train comments on active apps via console.
- [ ] **Interactive Protocols**: 'ASK TRAIN' direct dialogue system.

*The train never sleeps; it only waits for your next keystroke.*
